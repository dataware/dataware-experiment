Stuff that's missing / questions

* a third party client currently has no way, in the set of exchanges, of getting the end point url of the processor that will undertake the final processing request

* how does a resource bootstrap it's schema and details with it's dataware wrapper?

* How are queries that can be performed on data made available for third parties to browse and construct their own queries on?

* How are processes that are to be run DESCRIBED

* should resource offer access to data via a set of restful interfaces rather than through snadboxed python? 

Third party clients:

1st: Register with a catalog {need to ensure that this can only be done ONCE}

2nd: Query catalog: get list of resources available for installing a processor: {catalog, resourcename, resourceownerscatalogname, url of processing entity}
